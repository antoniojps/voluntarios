# Voluntarios

In times of distress we realize that the help of others is essential to live well in a society. Solidarity makes a huge difference in fighting the epidemic caused by the coronavirus.

To help, voluntarios is being developed with the objective of becoming the go to portuguese volunteering platform. The main goal is providing help with daily tasks and other needs, to people who need it most, given by ordinary people living in the neighborhood.

When using the platform volunteers create an account, indicating their areas of interest and competences. People who need volunteers for a given task can search, filtering by categories, location and skills, and find the ideal volunteer for the task.

The current situation makes it possible to see that there are weakened people who need help, not only during this season, but all year. We should all help fight the virus and contribute to a better and healthier society.
